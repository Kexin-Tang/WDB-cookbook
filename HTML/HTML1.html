    <title>Block VS Inline</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <hr>
        <i>This is a block</i>
        <br>
        &lt;div&gt; is a very common <b>block</b> element.<br>
        It will divide the section with other parts. Programmers can decorate the section as a whole.
        For example, these contents are in a block.
        <br>
        <i>This is a block</i>
        <hr>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In contrary, &lt;span&gt; is a common inline element.<br>
    It will just divide some contents in one line.<br>
    For example, <span><b><i>it is a span</i></b></span>.
</body>
